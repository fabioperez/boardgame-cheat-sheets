## Setup

- Place **9 Stone tiles** in a line between both players.
- Shuffle **all Clan cards** into a face-down deck and give 6 cards to each player.

## Gameplay

- On your turn, **play 1 card** face-up to any **unclaimed** Stone on your side, then **draw 1 card** (if the deck has cards).
- You can **try** to claim a stone at any time you have 3 cards on your side of that stone. You must have 3 cards on the stone to claim it.
    - If there are 3 cards on each side, the **stronger combination** wins.
    - **Order of strength** (strongest to weakest):
        1. **Color-Run** (three consecutive numbers in the same color)
        2. **Three of a Kind** (three cards of the same strength)
        3. **Color** (any three cards of the same color)
        4. **Run** (three consecutive numbers, any color)
        5. **Sum** (any three cards)
    - If tied: total strenght wins; then whoever finished their 3-card set **first** wins.
    - If your opponent has fewer than 3 cards, you can still claim if it's impossible for them to form a higher combination. You can only prove this with visible cards (not in your hand).
    - Once claimed, **move the Stone** to your side; do not play any more cards on any side.
- The player that controls **5 Stones** (anywhere) or **3 adjacent Stones** wins immediately.

## Variants

### Official Tactic Variant

- Shuffle the **Tactic cards** into a second deck. Each player now draws **7 cards** total.
- On your turn, **play either** a Clan or Tactic card. Then draw from **one** of the two decks (if available) to return to 7 cards.
- You **cannot** play more than **1 Tactic card over** what your opponent has played.
    - Example: if the opponent played two tactic cards so far, you can play at most three.
- When claiming a stone before your opponent has played all 3 cards, **unplayed Tactic cards are not considered** when determining if it's impossible for them to form a higher combination.
- **Tactic cards effects:**
    - **Elite Troops** act like Clan cards but let you choose color/strength when resolving.
        - **Joker:** Declare color/strength upon claiming a stone. Only **one Joker** allowed per player on the table.
        - **Spy**: Declare color upon claiming a stone. Has strength 7.
        - **Shield-Bearer**: Declare color and strength (either 1, 2, or 3) upon claiming a stone.
    - **Combat Modes** are placed on a Stone and modify how you form or assess combinations there.
        - **Blind-Man's Bluff**: to claim the Stone that has Blind-Man's Bluff on it, add only the strength of the cards played on it, without taking into account any possible combinations.
        - **Mud Fight**: claiming the stone that has this card requires four cards instead of three.
    - **Ruses** trigger special actions like drawing, moving, or discarding cards.
        - **Recruiter**: draw three cards from one or both of the decks. Choose two cards from your entire hand and place them at the bottom of the corresponding deck.
        - **Strategist**: choose a Clan or Tactic card on your side of the border on an unclaimed Stone. Place it face-up on a different unclaimed Stone or discard it face-up next to the deck.
        - **Banshee**: choose a Clan or Tactic card on your opponent's side of the border on an unclaimed Stone and discard it face-up next to the deck.
        - **Traiter** : choose a Clan card on your opponent's side of the border on an unclaimed Stone and place it on an unclaimed Stone on your side.

### Official Expert Variant

- **Claim Stones** only **at the start of your turn**, before you play a card. Your opponent can try to counter before your next turn.

## FAQ

**What if you cannot play a card?**
    - If each unclaimed Stone on your side already has 3 of your cards, you simply **skip playing**. You can still claim Stones if possible.
**Do I need to play consecutive cards in order?**
    - A Run (e.g. 2‑3‑4) is valid regardless of the order you played those cards.
**Can I claim a stone with fewer than 3 cards?**
    - You cannot claim with only 2 cards, even if you know your opponent can't beat it.
**Can I use my hand to prove a claim?**
    - You cannot use hidden cards in your hand to prove a claim. Only visible cards are allowed.
**What happens in the Tactic Variant if I only have Tactic cards or have completed all Stones?**
    - If you find yourself with only Tactic cards in hand or have already completed all the Stones available on your side of the border, you cannot play Clan cards. In this case, you can choose to pass and play no card or play a Tactic card.
**When claiming a stone in the Tactic Variant, do I consider unplayed Tactic cards?** ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2273701/proving-youve-won-a-stone-with-tactic-cards))
    - No. For example, if your opponent needs a red 7 and the red 7 is visible on the table, you can claim the stone even if they could potentially play a Joker or other Tactic card.
