## Setup

- **Players:** 2–5
    - For **2 players**, remove 2 colors (18 cards total).
    - For **3 players**, remove 1 color (9 cards total).
    - For **4–5 players**, remove no colors.
- **Starting Hand:**
    - **2 players:** each player takes 2 cards in different colors.
    - **3–5 players:** each player takes 1 card in a unique color.
- **Row Cards:**
    - **2 players:** use **green** row cards (3 total). Each has icons showing how many cards it can hold.
    - **3–5 players:** use **brown** row cards (1 per player) and return extras to the box.
- **Last Round Card:**
    - Remove it from the deck.
    - Shuffle the rest to form a face-down supply.
    - Deal 15 cards face-down, place the **last round card** on top, then place the remaining supply on top of that stack.
- **Summary Cards:** each player takes one, choosing the brown or gray side for scoring.
- Determine first player by lot.

## Turn

Do **one** of the following:

- **Draw and Place a Card:**
    - Draw the top card from the supply.
    - Place it face-up next to any row card that is not at capacity (usually 3 cards for brown rows; see green rows' icons for 2 players).
    - If all row cards are full, you must take a row.
- **Take a Row:**
    - Choose a row card that has at least 1 card.
    - Take that row (cards + row card) and place the cards in your area, sorted by color.
    - If you take a Joker, assign it to a color only at game's end.
    - After taking a row, you skip any further turns this round.

## Rounds

- A round ends when each player has taken exactly one row.
- Return row cards to the center.
- The player who took the last row card goes first in the next round.
- **2 players:** after both have taken a row, discard the unused (third) row.

## Final Round & Scoring

- When the **last round card** appears, it marks the final round.
- Assign each Joker to one of your colors.
- Choose **3 colors** to score **plus** points; the rest will score **minus** points:
    - **Brown Side** (recommended):
        - 1 → 1 point
        - 2 → 3 points
        - 3 → 6 points
        - 4 → 10 points
        - 5 → 15 points
        - 6+ → 21 points
    - **Gray Side:** see the summary card for values.
- Each "+2" card adds 2 points.
- Highest total wins.
