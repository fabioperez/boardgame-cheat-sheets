# Flip 7

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck and choose a Dealer.
    - The deck has 12x 12 cards, 11x 11 cards, 10x 10 cards and so on... Only exception is card 0 which has one copy.
    - The deck also has **action** and **score modifier** cards.
2. Dealer deals 1 face-up card to each player, resolving any Action cards immediately, until each player has one card.
3. Give each player paper/app to track scores; play until someone reaches **200 points**.

## Turn Sequence

- Dealer asks each **active** player, in order, to **Hit** or **Stay**, then go to the next player.
    - **Hit:** flip the next card face-up, resolve it, and keep playing.
    - **Stay:** flip your tableau face-down, bank your score, and become inactive.
- **Bust:** draw a Number card that duplicates one in your line → discard everything and score 0.
- **Flip 7:** collect 7 **unique** Number cards → round ends immediately; gain **+15 points**.
- A player that *busts* or *stays* becomes **inactive**.

## Action Cards

Action cards can be played on any active player including yourself.

- **Freeze:** target active player immediately banks points and exits the round.
- **Flip Three:** target active player flips the next **3** cards one by one; stop early if they Bust or Flip 7; resolve any new Flip Three/Freeze cards after all three flips.
- **Second Chance:** keep in front of you; if you later draw a duplicate Number, discard both the duplicate and this card instead of Busting. Only one per player; extra copies are passed to another active player or discarded. All Second Chance cards discard at round end.

## Modifier Cards

- **+2 / +4 / +6 / +8 / +10:** add the listed value to your final score.
- **×2:** double the **sum of your Number cards** before adding other Modifiers.
- Modifiers are **not** Number cards, cannot cause a Bust, and do not help you Flip 7.

## End of Round

1. Round ends when all players are inactive **or** someone achieves Flip 7.
2. For each non-busted player:
    - Add Number card values.
    - If you have ×2, double that sum.
    - Add any +N Modifiers.
    - Add +15 pts if you achieved Flip 7.

## Next Round

- Move all tableaus to a discard pile; do **not** reshuffle yet.
- Pass the remaining draw pile left; new Dealer begins.
- When the pile empties, shuffle the discard into a new deck (keep current tableaus on the table).

## End of Game

- When a round ends with at least one player at **200 pts or more**, the highest total wins.

## FAQ

- **Can I bust on a Modifier?** No. Only duplicate Number cards bust you.
- **Does Second Chance block Freeze?** No. Freeze still ends your round.
- **How do I apply ×2 and +N?** Double the sum with ×2 first, then add each +N Modifier.
- **Freeze dealt as first card?** Resolve immediately; may target any player (even undealt) or yourself.  
- **Can I Freeze myself?** Yes.  
- **Second Chance saved me—do I keep playing?** No; your turn ends.  
- **Scores tied ≥ 200?** Play full extra rounds until a single leader emerges.  
- **The only active player receives Freeze/Flip 3?** Must apply it to themself.  
- **Draw Flip 3 or Freeze during a Flip 3?** Set aside; after initial 3 flips resolve them (discard if you busted or Flip 7).  
- **Flip 3 drawn in initial deal?** Resolve (or give away) before the deal continues.  
- **Turn order after Flip 3 ends?** Resume with the player clockwise after the **original** Flip 3 recipient.  
- **Bust or Flip 7 during Flip 3?** Stop flipping immediately.  
- **Second Chance during Flip 3?**  
    - Keep the first one you draw; extra copies are passed/discarded.  
    - Usable later in the same Flip 3 sequence.  
- **Multiple action cards from Flip 3?** Assign them in the order flipped, then resolve in that same order.
