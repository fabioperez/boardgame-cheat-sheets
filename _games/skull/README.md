Each player has 4 discs. Three of them are flowers, and one of them is a skull.

## Gameplay

- Each player chooses 1 disc and places it face down on top of their game mat, creating their pile.
- **Play or challenge:** Starting with the first player (clockwise), players must either:
    - **Place another disc** face down on top of their pile.
    - **Declare a challenge** (mandatory if a player has no discs).
- **Challenge Phase:**
    - **Bid:** The challenging player states the number of discs to flip.
    - In clockwise order, each player must either:
        - **Raise** the previous bid.
        - **Pass** by pushing their disc pile to the center.
    - Continue until only one player remains; that player becomes the challenger.
- **Revelation Phase:**
    - The challenger must reveal discs equal to their bid, starting with their own pile, and then their opponents' piles, choosing one top disc per time from any opponent in any order (it can be multiple times from the same opponent).
    - **If a Skull is revealed:**
        - Stop flipping discs and lose the bet.
        - **Retrieve discs:** All players take their discs back into their hands.
        - **Discard a disc:** The opponent whose disc revealed the Skull discards one of the challenger's face-down discs. If you reveal your own Skull, choose one from your own discs.
        - **Eliminate:** Remove the challenger if they lose their last disc.
    - **If Roses are revealed as bid:**
        - Flip your game mat to the **Roses side**.
        - A second successful bet wins the game.
    - **Next round order:** The challenger plays first next round. If eliminated, the first player becomes the owner of the revealed Skull; if you reveal your own Skull, you choose the first player.

## Lingo

- **Burn out:** A bet that would reveal all discs on the table.
- **Under the gun:** The second player to speak after a challenge is issued.
- **The cop:** The last player to speak before the highest bidder.
- **Stoned:** A player with only one disc remaining.
