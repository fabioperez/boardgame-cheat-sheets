## Setup

- **Cards**: 36 (three each of numbers 1–12).
- **Player Count**: 3–6 players.
- **Deal**:
    - 3 players: **9 cards** each + **9** in the middle (face down).
    - 4 players: **7 cards** each + **8** in the middle.
    - 5 players: **6 cards** each + **6** in the middle.
    - 6 players: **5 cards** each + **6** in the middle.
- **Sort**: Each player looks at their cards privately and sorts them by number.
- **Mode**: Decide if you are playing **Simple** or **Spicy**. The **7 trio** (three 7s) always wins immediately.
    - **Simple**: Win by collecting any **3 trios** (or the **7 trio**).
    - **Spicy**: Win by collecting **2 connected trios** (numbers that share a connection icon) or the **7 trio**.

## How to Play

- Determine a first player (whoever ate avocado most recently).
- On your turn, keep revealing cards (one at a time) to find a matching set of **three identical numbers**:
    1. **Ask for Lowest or Highest**: Request any opponent (or yourself) to reveal their **lowest** or **highest** card. Place it face up.
    2. **Reveal From the Middle**: Flip any face-down card in the middle face up.
- You may repeat the same action type multiple times (e.g., keep asking for opponents' highest cards), but the moment:
    - You reveal a card **that doesn't match** the last revealed number: all revealed cards are returned face down (to owners or the middle), and your turn ends.
    - You find **three matching numbers**: take that trio and place it face up in front of you, and your turn ends.
- When revealing from your own hand, it **must be** your lowest or highest card.
- If your hand is empty, you can still reveal from the middle or from opponents.

## FAQ

- **What if I reveal a card that matches one but not the other already revealed?**  
  You only check if it matches the *most recently* revealed card. As soon as one doesn't match, return them all face down and end your turn.
- **Do I have to reveal multiple cards each turn?**  
  You continue revealing until you fail a match or complete a trio.

## Variants

### Team Variant (4 or 6 Players)

- **Form Teams**: Sit opposite your partner. Two teams if four players, three teams if six.
- **Deal**: Shuffle and deal all cards evenly among players. No center pile.
- **Initial Swap**: After sorting, each pair may secretly swap one card. All teams do this simultaneously.
- **Communication**: Swapping is the only communication between partners—no signals or hints.
- **Gameplay**: All main rules apply. When a team completes a trio, the opposing team(s) may make one new swap.
- **Shared Trios**: Partners share any collected trios in front of one partner.
- **Winning**: A team wins immediately upon collecting 3 trios (Simple), 2 connected trios (Spicy), or the 7 trio.
