## Setup

- Shuffle Region cards and deal **3 face‑down** to each player.
    - Advanced: Deal **5 Region cards** to each player; each player selects **3 cards** and removes the other 2; shuffle discarded cards into the Region deck.
- Place the Region deck at the center and reveal *(players + 1)* Region cards.
- Shuffle Sanctuary cards into a face‑down deck beside the Region deck.

## Game Flow

- **Each Round** comprises three phases:
    - **Phase 1: Simultaneous Play**
        - Each player selects a Region card from hand and places it face down.
        - Players reveal their chosen card and add it to their tableau, arranged left to right.
    - **Phase 2: Gaining Sanctuaries**
        - If your played card's exploration duration exceeds your previous card, draw Sanctuary cards.
        - For each **Clue** on your Regions and Sanctuaries, draw 1 extra Sanctuary card.
    - **Phase 3: Refresh & Refill**
        - The first player is determined by the lowest exploration duration from Phase 1, and so on.
        - On each player's turn:
            - Choose a Region card from the center to refill your hand to 3 cards.
            - If you have any Sanctuary cards in your hand, add **1** to your tableau; discard any extras face down under the Sanctuary deck.
        - Remove the remaining center card from the game.
        - Reveal new Region cards *(players + 1)* unless it is the 8th round.
- The game **ends after the 8th round**, when each player will have 8 Region cards.
- **Scoring Process**:
    - Flip all Region cards face down; keep Sanctuaries face up.
    - Reveal Region cards one by one from right (last played) to left.
    - For each Region, calculate fame from its quest using all revealed Regions and Sanctuaries.
        - Some quests may have prerequisites that must be satisfied using resources.
    - After all Regions are revealed, calculate the fame for sanctuaries.
    - The player with the highest fame wins.
        - In a tie, the player with the **lowest exploration duration card** wins.
- In round 8, do not reveal new Region cards but you may still play a Sanctuary.

## Cards

- **Region Cards**:
    - Represent biomes by color and pattern; display a unique exploration duration (1‑68).
    - Indicate daytime or nighttime exploration and may grant **Clues**.
    - Show a denizen's quest that awards **fame** when completed.
- **Resources**:
    - Collect **stones**, **chimeras**, and **thistles**.
        - Number of resources: stones > chimeras > thistles.
    - Use resources to satisfy quest prerequisites.
- **Sanctuaries cards**:
    - May count as a Region of a specific type and color for scoring quests.
    - May have **Clues** and **resources**.
    - May provide **fame** at game end.

Valid only for 2 or 3 players. Source: [BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3412890/2-3-player-variant)).

## FAQ

- **What if there's a tie?** ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3204882/tie-for-the-first-place))
    - The player with the lowest exploration card wins.
- **If I do not play a Region with a higher exploration duration than the one before, do I still get Sanctuary cards?**
    - No. You only gain Sanctuary cards if your newly played Region's duration is strictly higher. The total cards you draw depends on the **Clues** in your play area.
- **When can I look at the Sanctuary cards I draw, and must I hide them from others?**
    - Look at them immediately after revealing your played Region (Phase 2), but keep them hidden from opponents. In Phase 3, after you choose **1** sanctuary to add to your tableau, place any remaining cards face down under the Sanctuary deck.
- **Some references say "the maps" tell me how many to draw. What does that mean?**
    - It refers to your **Clues**. Each Clue lets you draw one extra Sanctuary card beyond the base of one.
- **What if we run out of Sanctuary cards in a larger game?**
    - It is highly unlikely. If it happens, deal available Sanctuaries in the same order used for claiming Region cards. If none remain, no more can be drawn.
- **How are resources, day/night, and other features distributed?** ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3284463/resource-distribution))
    - Stones: 18 on Region cards; 9 on Sanctuary cards.
    - Chimeras: 14 on Region cards; 7 on Sanctuary cards.
    - Thistles: 10 on Region cards; 5 on Sanctuary cards.
    - Day cards: 47.
    - Night cards: 21.
    - Clues/maps: 16 on Region cards; 8 on Sanctuaries.
    - Colors are equally distributed: 17 of each on Region cards, 5 of each on Sanctuaries.
