## Setup

- Each player gets **1 tracker sheet** and a pen/pencil.
- Choose a **Start Player** and give them all **6 dice** (yellow, blue, green, orange, purple, white).
- Play **4 rounds** with 4 players, **5 rounds** with 3 players, or **6 rounds** with 2 players.

## Game Flow

- Each player will be **Active Player** once per round; others are **Passive Players**.
- As **Active Player**:
    - Roll all 6 dice.
    - **Choose 1 die** and mark its color section on your sheet. **Move all dice with lower values** to the "silver platter."
    - **Re-roll** remaining dice (up to **3 total rolls**). Each time you choose a die, move lower-valued dice to the platter.
    - If you cannot use any result, you may still roll again, but it counts as one of your 3 rolls.
- As **Passive Players**:
    - After the Active Player's final choice, **each Passive Player** picks **one die from the silver platter** and marks it on their sheet.
    - If none of those dice are usable, pick one from the Active Player's chosen dice instead.
- Pass dice clockwise for the next Active Player.

## Tracker Sheet

- **Yellow**
    - Cross out one matching number each time you select a yellow die.
    - Completing a column gives **points** (circle them). Completing a row grants a **bonus**.
- **Blue**
    - Add the **blue die** to the **white die** (or vice versa if the white die is chosen as "blue").
    - Cross out that total in any order. Completing a row or column grants a **bonus**.
- **Green**
    - Fill boxes **left to right** without skipping.
    - The die must be **â‰¥** the requirement in the next box. The **last crossed number** is your final green score.
- **Orange**
    - Fill boxes **left to right** without skipping.
    - Simply record the die's value (some boxes have multipliers).
    - Sum all recorded values for your orange score.
- **Purple**
    - Fill boxes **left to right** without skipping.
    - Each next purple die must be **higher** than the previous, unless the previous was **6** (then any value is valid).
    - Sum all recorded values for your purple score.
- **White Die** is wild. Treat it as one of the above colors when selecting it.

## Actions

- **Reroll**
    - Use only as the Active Player to reroll **all currently rolled dice** (not those on your sheet or on the silver platter).
- **+1**
    - Use any time after dice selection (end of a turn, Active or Passive).
    - Mark one of the **6 dice** again (even one already used by you this turn).
    - Each die can only be selected **once per +1** action, but you may use multiple +1s if available.

## Bonuses

- Unlocked by completing rows, columns, or by certain track boxes.
- **Instantly apply** each bonus (they can trigger further bonuses).
- A ""Fox"" is worth the **same points as your lowest-scoring area** at game end.

## End of Game

- After the last round, each player may still use any **+1** actions.
- Tally each colored area's score, then add **foxes** (each equals your lowest area's score).
- **Highest total** wins.

## FAQ

- **Q:** What if I choose a high-value die first and fewer than 3 rolls occur?
    - If you select a high die early, the others might move to the platter, potentially leaving no dice to reroll.
- **Q:** Do I lose a reroll if none of my dice can be placed?
    - Yes, each reroll attempt counts, even if you cannot mark anything with the current dice.
- **Q:** Can multiple Passive Players pick the same die?
    - Yes, each Passive Player independently chooses any one die on the silver platter.
- **Q:** When can I use the +1 action? ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1949973/extra-die-action-clarification))
    - **A:** Use +1 only **after** the Active Player finishes assigning all their dice and all Passive Players have chosen a die from the silver platter. At that point, you may perform one or more +1 actions during that turn.
- **Q:** Which dice are eligible for +1? ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1949973/extra-die-action-clarification))
    - **A:** You may choose **any** of the six dice for the current round, including one used by the Active Player or one you personally used in your regular (Active or Passive) pick.
- **Q:** Can I use multiple +1 actions in a single turn? ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1949973/extra-die-action-clarification))
    - **A:** Yes. You may perform as many +1 actions as you have available. **However, you cannot use +1 on the exact same die more than once** in the same turn.
- **Q:** Can I select the same die for my regular turn and immediately pick it again using +1? ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1949973/extra-die-action-clarification))
    - **A:** Yes. You can pick, for example, a purple die in your regular action, then use a +1 on that same purple die. **But** if you use yet another +1 in that turn, you must pick a **different** die.
