## Setup

1. Each player gets the **11 money cards** of one colour and keep them hidden from others.
2. Shuffle the **16 status cards** (10 Luxuries 1-10, 3 Prestige, 3 Disgrace) into a face-down deck.  
3. Choose a **start player**.

## Turn Structure

- **Reveal** the top **status card** and resolve its effects.
- **Luxury / Prestige**
    - Starting with the start player and moving clockwise, choose **bid** or **pass**.
    - **Bid:** add money cards so your total exceeds the current bid; cards stay on the table.
    - **Pass:** take back all bid cards; you may not bid again this round.
    - When one bidder remains, they **win** the card, discard spent money face-down, and become the next start player.
    - If everyone passes without bidding, the last passer takes the card for free.
- **Disgrace**
    - Players bid to **avoid** the card.
    - The **first** player to pass takes the Disgrace (return money to hand); others discard their bid money.
    - Winner becomes next start player.

## Disgrace Effects

- **Faux Pas:** immediately discard one luxury you own (or the next one you win); then discard Faux Pas.  
- **Passé:** −5 status.  
- **Scandale:** halve final status.  

## End of Game

- As soon as the **fourth dark-green card** (Prestige or Scandale) is revealed, end the game immediately; do not auction that card.

## Cast-Out Phase

- All players reveal remaining money.  
- **All players with the least money are eliminated** and cannot win.  

## Scoring

1. Add values of all Luxury cards.  
2. Apply Passé (−5).  
3. Multiply by 2ⁿ for n Prestige cards (×2, ×4, ×8).  
4. If you have Scandale, halve the total.  
5. Highest status among non-eliminated players wins; ties → most money → highest single Luxury.  

## FAQ

- **Tied for least money?** All tied players are eliminated.  
- **Are discarded money cards public?** No, place them face-down.  
- **Can I reclaim bid cards?** Only if you pass before the auction ends.
