## Setup

- Shuffle all gift cards.
- Deal **1 card face up** to each player (their "gift").
- Place the remaining cards face up in a **draw pile** (the "gift shop").
- **Remember which gift is in front of each player.**

## Turn Sequence

- The **last player to have received a gift** goes first.
- **Draw** the top card from the gift shop, **show** it to everyone, then **flip it face down** in front of you.
- **Pass** the gift in the direction shown by the arrow on the card back.

## Accepting a Gift

- Say **"thank you"** if you believe it's the gift described.
- Place it **face down** above your old gift.
- **Give away your old gift** (the face-down card closest to you) to the next player indicated by its arrow, announcing it out loud.
- Continue until someone refuses a gift.

## Refusing a Gift

- If you think the card is **not** what the giver announced, say **"That's not a ___!"**
- Reveal the card.
- The player who was **wrong** (giver or receiver) takes the card as a **penalty point** (place it face up in a personal discard pile).
- That player **must draw a new gift** from the gift shop and **pass** it immediately (do **not** keep it as your new gift).

## Ending the Game

- The game ends as soon as any player has **3 penalty cards**.
- Each penalty card = **1 point**. Lowest total wins.
- Optional: Play multiple rounds, summing penalty points. **Fewest** total points wins.

## Variants

- **Harder Game**: Separate cards by arrow color (black or white). Play with only one color.
- **Two Players or Even Harder**: Each player starts with **2 gifts**. The rest follows the same rules.

## FAQ

- **What if I forget my gift?**
    Bluff confidently. Announce an item and hope others hesitate to refuse.
- **Should I ever pretend to be unsure?**
    Yes, double-bluffing might trick players into refusing a correct card, giving **them** the penalty instead.
