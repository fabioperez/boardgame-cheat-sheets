    - **3 Players:** 6 cards, 1 Jester.
    - **4 Players:** 5 cards, 2 Jesters.
- Place shuffled **Kings** face‑down.
- Place shuffled **Queens** face‑down on top of Kings.
- Place shuffled **Jacks** face‑down on top of Queens.
- Place shuffled **A–10 + Jesters** face‑down as the Tavern deck.
- Flip the top card to reveal the current enemy.
- Give *hand size* cards from the Tavern deck to each player.

## Gameplay

- **On your turn**, attack the enemy by playing cards from your hand.
- **Step 1 – Play a Card or Yield:**
    - **Play a card:** Place it face‑up; its number is your attack value.
    - **Yield:** Declare "Yield" to skip Steps 2 and 3 and proceed directly to damage.
    - **Restriction:** You cannot yield if every other player yielded on their last turn.
- **Step 2 – Activate Suit Power:**
    - **♥️ Hearts:** Heal from the discard:
        - Shuffle the discard pile.
        - Count out cards equal to the attack value and place them under the Tavern deck.
        - Return the discard pile face‑up.
    - **♦️ Diamonds:** Draw cards:
        - Each player draws one card in clockwise order until a total equal to the attack value is drawn.
        - Skip players at maximum hand size.
    - **♣️ Clubs:** Double damage:
        - Count the card's attack value as double during damage calculation.
    - **♠️ Spades:** Shield:
        - Reduce the enemy's attack by the card's attack value.
        - Shield effects from multiple Spades accumulate until the enemy is defeated.
    - **Note:** Red suit powers resolve immediately; black suit powers resolve later.
- **Step 3 – Deal Damage:**
    - Add the played card's attack (or doubled value for Clubs) to the enemy's damage.
    - **If total damage ≥ enemy's health:**
        - Discard the enemy and all played cards.
        - If damage **equals the enemy's health exactly**, place the enemy face‑down on top of the Tavern deck.
        - Flip the next Castle card to reveal a new enemy.
        - Skip Step 4; the **player who defeated the enemy** starts the next turn.
- **Step 4 – Suffer Damage:**
    - If the enemy survives, it attacks the current player.
    - Reduce the enemy's attack by the total Spades played.
    - Discard cards from your hand with a combined value at least equal to the enemy's (modified) attack.
        - **Animal Companions** count as 1; **Jesters** count as 0.
    - **Failure:** If you cannot discard enough, you die and all players lose.
    - End your turn; the next player in clockwise order begins.

## Special Rules

- **Communication:**
    - Do not reveal hand contents.
    - Share only public information (e.g., card counts, Tavern deck size).
    - After a Jester is played, relax restrictions on expressing general play preferences.
- **Animal Companions:**
    - Play alone or pair with one other card (excluding Jesters).
    - Add 1 to the attack value and apply the companion's suit power together with the other card's suit power.
    - When pairing two Animal Companions of the same suit, apply the suit power only once.
- **Combos:**
    - Combine 2–4 cards of the same number if their total attack value is 10 or less.
    - Resolve all suit powers at the combined attack value.
    - When combining Hearts and Diamonds, resolve healing before drawing.
    - Animal Companies cannot join combos.
- **Enemy Immunity:**
    - An enemy is immune to the suit power of cards matching its own suit.
    - Play a Jester to cancel an enemy's immunity.
- **Playing the Jester:**
    - Play the Jester on its own; it has 0 attack value.
    - It negates enemy immunity (until the next enemy) so that matching suit powers take effect.
    - After playing, skip Steps 3 and 4 and **choose the next player**.
    - **Note:** For Spades enemies, Spades played before the Jester still reduce attack, but Clubs' double damage does not apply.
- **Drawing a Defeated Enemy:**
    - In hand, treat:
        - **Jacks** as 10,
        - **Queens** as 15,
        - **Kings** as 20.
    - Apply their suit powers as normal when played.
