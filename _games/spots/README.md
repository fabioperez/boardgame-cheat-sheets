## Setup

1. Take 6 basic **trick tiles** (faceup) and place them in the middle.
    - Always include **Howl** and **Roll Over**, and take four other random tiles (one of each color).
2. Shuffle the deck; deal **2 dog cards** (gray side up) to each player. Place the rest faceup in the center.
3. Put all dice and treats in a shared area.
4. Each player takes **1 yard**, **1 treat**, and **1 die**. Roll that die and bury it in your yard. The highest buried die goes first.

## How to Play

You can never have more than **6** total dog cards (scored + unscored).

In your turn, do one of the following:

- **Do a Trick**  
    1. Choose a **faceup** trick tile, flip it facedown, and follow its steps **in order**.  
    2. If a step says “may,” it’s optional. If you **cannot** perform it, skip it.  
    3. **Rolling Dice**:  
        - Take dice from the supply unless the trick says otherwise.  
        - You may spend **1 treat** to reroll **all** dice you just rolled (no partial rerolls).  
        - After rolling (and any rerolls), **place** matching dice on your dog cards or **bury** them if you can’t/won’t place them.  
    4. If the **total spots** in your yard exceed **7**, you bust. Immediately end your turn and discard all buried dice and all dice on your dogs.  
    5. If there’s only **1 faceup** tile at the start of your turn, place **1 treat** on it, then flip **all** tiles faceup before choosing one.
    6. If you fill **all** your faceup dogs while performing a trick, score them immediately (see _"Score Your Dogs"_ below) without using up your turn.
- **Score Your Dogs**  
    1. You must have **at least one** completed dog (all dice spaces filled).  
    2. Discard dice from completed dogs and flip them facedown (scored).  
    3. Draw new dog cards for each scored dog until you reach 6 total cards.

    - The moment you have **6** scored dogs, you **win immediately**.

## FAQ

Sources: rulebook and [BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2993783/official-trick-tile-clarifications).

### Q: What if I run out of dice or treats?

A: Take what is available. If there are zero dice at the start of your turn, everyone busts and discards all dice. Continue your turn normally afterward.

### Q: Do I bust before I can spend a treat to reroll?

A: No. You decide on rerolls right after you see your dice but before placing/burying them. Use treats to avoid a bust if you wish.

### Q: What if I can’t place a die on a dog?

A: You must bury any dice you cannot (or do not want to) place.

### Q: BOLT—How does stopping early work?

A: You can only decide to stop between dice rolls. Once you roll a die, you must either place or bury it (with optional treat rerolls). Count the dice **left to roll**, not the ones already rolled, to see if you’re allowed to stop.

### Q: CHASE—Why do I roll more dice each time?

A: Each repeat of CHASE adds +1 to the number of dice you roll. First roll 1, then if you repeat, roll 2, then 3, etc.

### Q: DIG—Can I make other players bust?

A: Yes. You may raise or lower **others’** buried dice values. If an opponent’s total goes above 7, they bust immediately. You cannot raise a single die above 6.

### Q: DOGPILE—What if I have no dice anywhere?

A: You must still roll 2 dice for DOGPILE. Each repeat requires rolling 2 new dice plus 1 more taken from your yard or dogs.

### Q: FETCH—Must I pick a number I actually rolled?

A: Yes. You must choose one of the faces rolled. You cannot pick a number you didn’t see just to avoid taking dice.

### Q: GOBBLE—How many treats do I return?

A: Look for the **highest-value empty space** on all your dogs. Return treats equal to that space’s value.

### Q: GUARD—Can I name zero?

A: Yes. If you do, you must discard all dice you rolled. If you spend a treat to reroll, you do **not** change your named number.

### Q: HOWL—What if I already have 6 dog cards?

A: You still perform the second step and roll 1 die. You can’t skip it.

### Q: PLAY DEAD—Must I place every die I can?

A: No. You can bury any die—even if it matches a dog space—to gain treats or manage your yard total.

### Q: RUN—How do I keep rolling multiple dice safely?

A: Each repeat lets you draw a brand-new die from the supply, roll it, then place or bury it before continuing. Stop any time if you want to avoid busting.

### Q: ROLL OVER—Do I skip the second step if I have no buried dice?

A: No. You can still roll 1 die even if you have nothing in your yard.

### Q: SEARCH—What if I can’t total exactly eight?

A: Discard all dice you rolled and end your turn if you cannot form eight.

### Q: SPRINT—How do I calculate the number of dice?

A: Each time you repeat SPRINT, recount the unfilled spaces on your dog cards. As you complete dogs, this total may drop.

## Variants

### Off Leash Hours

- **Use all trick tiles**. Stack tiles of the same color in a random order.
- When you choose a tile, flip only the **top** tile of that stack.
- During **reset**, any facedown tiles are:
    - **Flipped faceup** and
    - **Moved** to the bottom of their stack.
- **Howl** and **Roll Over** remain in play as usual.

### Solo Mode

- You face an AI opponent called **d0g**, which starts with:
    - **1 treat**, **no yard**, and **no dogs**.
- You go first. On d0g’s turn, **roll 1 die**:
    - If it corresponds to a **faceup** tile, d0g flips it **facedown**, taking any treats on it.
    - If it corresponds to a **facedown** tile, d0g **scores** the top card of the dog deck.
- If d0g starts with only **1 faceup** tile, reset tiles like you would on your own turn.
- If d0g ever has **2 or more** treats, it spends 2 and **scores** the top card of the deck.
- **Win/Lose**: You win by scoring **6** dogs before d0g does. Adjust difficulty by giving d0g more or fewer starting treats.
