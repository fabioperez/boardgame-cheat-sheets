# The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth

## Setup

- **Choose roles**: One plays Fellowship; one plays Sauron.
- **Place boards**: Put the central board between players; assemble the Quest of the Ring track below it.
- **Start Units**: Fellowship places 2 Units in **Arnor**; Sauron places 2 Units in **Mordor**.
- **Coins**: Fellowship takes **3 Coins**; Sauron takes **2 Coins**. Put the rest in a supply.
- **Alliance tokens**: Shuffle each Race's stack facedown and place above the board.
- **Landmark tiles**: Reveal 3 faceup; stack the rest facedown.
- **Chapter decks**: Separate and shuffle the 3 decks (I, II, III). For Chapter I, arrange cards in the center as instructed; put 3 facedown in a discard pile. Sauron takes the first turn.

## Turn Overview

- **Take a Chapter Card** (from the central layout):
    - **Play it**: Pay any required **Skills** and/or **Coin** costs.
        - If you lack a required Skill, pay **1 Coin** per missing symbol.
        - **Chaining**: If a card shows a chaining icon you already have in play, ignore its Skill requirement.
    - **Or Discard it**: Gain a number of Coins equal to the current chapter (1, 2, or 3).
- **Or Take a Landmark Tile**:
    - Pay its Skill cost plus **1 additional Coin** for each Fortress you already have on the board.
    - **Place a Fortress** on the indicated region and apply the tile's effect.
- **Reveal new cards** if needed so that unchosen cards remain visible.

## Chapters

- **End of a Chapter**: When the last card of that chapter is taken, set up the next chapter's layout; reveal Landmark tiles until 3 are faceup (if available). Continue play.
- The game proceeds through **three chapters** unless a player achieves an immediate victory.

## Card & Tile Effects

- **Grey (Skills)**: Each symbol (Ruse, Strength, Courage, Knowledge, Leadership) may be used once on your turn to fulfill costs.
- **Green (Races)**: Collect matching symbols to form alliances (see Alliances).
- **Red (Units)**: Place all indicated Units into **one** of the two displayed regions; if enemy Units are there, trigger a conflict.
- **Purple (Maneuvers)**: **Chapter III only**; each icon lets you **move** a Unit, **remove** an enemy Unit, or make the opponent **lose 1 Coin** (as shown on the card).
- **Yellow (Coins)**: Gain the depicted number of Coins immediately.
- **Blue (Ring)**: Advance your character on the Quest track by the number of Ring icons shown.
- **Landmark Tiles**: Place a Fortress in the indicated region and gain a unique benefit.

## Conflicts & Movement

- **Movement**: Move a Unit to an adjacent region for each movement icon or effect used.
- **Conflict**: If you place or move Units into a region containing enemy Units, each side removes one Unit until one side (or both) is gone. Fortresses don't trigger conflicts and don't remove Units.

## Alliances

- **2 Matching Symbols** (e.g., two Hobbits): Take the top 2 tokens of that Race; pick 1 to keep; return the other facedown.
- **3 Different Symbols** (once per game): Take the top token from each of the 3 Races; keep 1; return the others facedown.
- Alliance tokens grant extra effects (shown on each token).

## Quest of the Ring

- Fellowship moves **Frodo and Sam**; Sauron moves **the Nazgûl**.
- Passing a bonus space grants the shown effect.
- If Frodo and Sam reach **Mount Doom**, the Fellowship immediately wins; if the Nazgûl catches them, Sauron wins.

## Victory

- **Immediate Win** if you:
    - Complete the Quest of the Ring (Fellowship or Sauron),
    - Have **6 different Race** symbols in play,
    - Occupy **all 7 regions** (Fortresses/Units).
- **If no immediate victory** by the end of Chapter III: the player with presence in the most regions **wins**. In a tie, **share the victory**.
