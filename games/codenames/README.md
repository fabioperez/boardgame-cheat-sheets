# Codenames

## Setup

- Split into two teams of similar size.
- Each team chooses one **spymaster**; other players for the same team are **field operatives**.
- Shuffle and place **25 codename cards** in a 5×5 grid.
- Randomly pick a **key card** and slide it into the stand so only spymasters see it.
- The key shows words belonging to **Red** team, **Blue** team, **innocent bystanders** (pale), and the **assassin** (black X).
- The team indicated by the edge color on the key starts and must guess **9** words; the other team has **8**.

## Gameplay

- On your turn, the spymaster gives a **one‑word clue** and a **number** indicating how many words relate to that clue.
    - Do not give additional hints, gestures, or extra wording.
    - Never use any visible codename or its derived form as your clue.
- Field operatives discuss and **touch a card** to guess.
    - If correct, cover the card with your team's agent card and guess again.
    - If it’s an **innocent bystander**, cover it (with the bystander card) and end your turn.
    - If it’s the other team’s card, cover it (with the other team's agent card) and end your turn (helping the other team).
    - If it’s the **assassin**, you immediately lose.
- You may keep guessing until you’ve reached the clue number (plus one optional extra guess) or you decide to stop.

## Ending the Game

- Win by covering all your team’s words first.
- If you reveal the **assassin**, your team loses immediately.
- You can also win during the other team’s turn if they guess your last word by mistake.

## Variants

- **Two-Player/Co‑op:** Use the same setup. One player is spymaster, the other is operative. The “other team” covers one of their own words each turn.
- **Three-Player:** Two spymasters, one operative guessing for both teams. The usual win conditions apply.

## FAQ

- **What if a clue is invalid?**
    - Your turn ends immediately. The opposing spymaster may cover one of their words before giving their next clue.
- **Do we use the timer?**
    - Only if you wish. Flip it to encourage quicker decisions or if anyone is taking too long.
