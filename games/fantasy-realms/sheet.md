# Fantasy Realms

## Setup

### 3–6 Players

- Deck & Deal
  - Shuffle the deck.
  - Deal each player **7 cards** (this is your "realm").
  - Place the remaining deck face‑down; discards are placed face‑up in a common area.

### 2 Players

- **No Initial Deal:** unlike the rules for 3-6 players, **neither player starts with any cards**.
- **Drafting Your Hand:**
  - On your turn, if you have fewer than 7 cards, choose to acquire cards until you have a full hand. You may either:
    - **Draw two cards from the deck, then discard one** (keeping the other), **or**
    - **Pick any one face‑up card from the common discard area.**
- Continue taking turns in this "drafting phase" until both players have a hand of **7 cards**.

## Gameplay

- On your turn, choose either:

 1. **Draw from the deck:** Draw the top card, then choose one card to discard to the common discard area.
 2. **Take from the discard area:** Pick any one face‑up card. (In either case, after adding the new card to your hand, discard one card.)

- Your hand remains at 7 cards at all times.
- End of Game:
  - **3-6 players**: the game ends immediately when the common discard area reaches **10 cards** (in the core game).
  - **2 players**: The game ends when the common discard area accumulates **12 cards**.
  - Then, score your 7‑card hand by adding each card's base strength plus any bonuses or penalties from synergies.
    - Use [this web app](https://fantasy-realms.github.io/index.html) to assist with scoring.
  - In a tie, the hand with the lower total base strength wins.

## Bonus & Penalty Terms

- **WITH** — If a card grants a bonus **with** a specific card or suit, you only gain that bonus once, regardless of how many such cards you have.
- **FOR EACH** — If a card grants a bonus or penalty **for each** of a certain type, apply that bonus or penalty for every such card in your hand.
- **BLANKS** — Some cards **blank** others, removing their suit, base strength, and any effects.
  - **BLANKED UNLESS** — A card may be **blanked unless** you have a specified card or suit. If you meet the condition, it's not blanked.
- **CLEARS** — Some cards **clear** penalties, removing or preventing them before final scoring.

## FAQ

- **What does it mean when a card is "blanked"?**
  - When a card is blanked by another card's penalty, it is treated as if it has no base strength, no suit, and no bonus or penalty effects. Essentially, it contributes nothing to your final score.
- **What is a key strategy for winning in Fantasy Realms?**
  - Focus on creating synergy between cards. Be mindful of cards that can blank others or provide large "FOR EACH" bonuses. Also, pay attention to what your opponents discard; sometimes, you can benefit by grabbing a card from the discard area that completes a powerful combo in your hand.
- **Can clearing a penalty do harm?**
  - No, clearing a penalty or part of a penalty should always help you — never hurt you. ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2601512/war-dirigible-army-rangers))

## Variants

- **Real-time variant**
  - Deal 7 cards to each player. Start a two minutes timer. Player can trade cards as they wish, even in different numbers, until the timer ends. It is not allowed to lay all of your cards face up during trading. ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2882269/fun-real-time-variant))
- **2-player draft rule for 3+ players**
  - Use the 2-player rules for drafting cards in games of 3+ players. (<https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2799912/playing-the-two-player-variant-with-more-than-two>)
