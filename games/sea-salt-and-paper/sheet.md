# Sea Salt and Paper

## Setup

- Shuffle the cards into a deck and place it face‑down.
- Reveal the first two cards and form two face‑up discard piles.

## Game Turn

- **1. Draw a Card:**
    - Either take the top two cards from the deck, add one to your hand, and discard the other to a chosen discard pile.
    - Or take the top card from one of the discard piles (do not look through the piles).
- **2. Play Duo Cards (optional):**
    - Pair specific cards (crab, boat, fish, or swimmer & shark) by playing them face‑up to trigger their effects.
    - You may trigger more than one effect per turn.
- **3. End the Round:**
    - If your hand and played cards total **7 points or more**, you may choose to end the round.

## End of the Round

- If the deck is empty at the end of a turn, end the round immediately without scoring.
- Choose between **STOP** or **LAST CHANCE**:
    - **STOP:** Score immediately.
    - **LAST CHANCE:** Bet you have the highest score.
        - Opponents take one final turn (draw and play cards) before scoring.
        - If your total equals or exceeds opponents’ totals, score your card points plus a **color bonus** (1 point per card of your dominant color); otherwise, score only the color bonus.
- Shuffle all cards and reform the deck and discard piles for the next round; play passes to the player on the left of the one who ended the round.

## End of Game

- **Win Instantly** by playing all **4 mermaid cards**.
- Otherwise, end the game when a player reaches or exceeds the required victory points:
    - **2 players:** 40 points
    - **3 players:** 35 points
    - **4 players:** 30 points
- The player with the most points wins; if tied, the player who played last in the final round wins.
