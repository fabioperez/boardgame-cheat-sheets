# Air, Land & Sea

## Setup

- Place the three **Theater boards** (Air, Land, Sea) in a row.
- Shuffle the **18-card deck**. Each player draws **6 cards** (the rest are not used this round).
- Choose one player to be the **Supreme Commander** (first player).

## Gameplay

- **Play a Card**: On your turn, either:
    - **Face Up**: Place it in its matching Theater (Air, Land, or Sea) and apply any text.
    - **Face Down**: Treat it as **power 2**, ignoring its text or Theater.
- **Card Effects** are resolved immediately. Some effects move or flip cards. If an effect conflicts with another rule, the card effect takes precedence.
    - **Instant Abilities** take effect immediately after the Battle card is played or if the card is revealed by being flipped face-up.
    - **Ongoing Abilities** are always in effect as long as the card is face-up. If a card with an Ongoing Ability is flipped face-down, the ability no longer has any effect (unless that card is revealed again).
- **Withdrawing**: You may withdraw instead of playing a card if you believe you cannot win. This immediately ends the round.

## End of Round

- If no one withdraws, the round ends after both players have played all **6 cards**.
- **Determine Control**: Compare total power in each Theater. Ties mean no one controls that Theater.
- **Winning**: If you control at least **2 Theaters**, you win the round.

## Scoring

- **If a player withdraws**:
    - The opponent scores a number of points based on how many cards the withdrawing player has already placed, based on the Supreme Commander's cards.
- **If the round ends with all cards played**, whoever controls **2 Theaters** scores **6 points**.
- Tally points and start a new round. Keep playing rounds until one player reaches or exceeds **12 points**.

## Tactical Ability Key Terms

- **Flip**: Turn a face-up card face-down or a face-down card face-up. Unless stated otherwise, flip any card -- yours or your opponent's.
- **Uncovered/Covered**: Some abilities only affect uncovered or covered cards. If not specified, assume they can affect any card.
- **Play**: When an ability instructs you to play a card, place it from your hand into a Theater, following all normal placement rules.
- **Non-Matching Theaters**: A card in a “wrong” Theater does not suffer penalties. Its **Strength** counts normally toward control.
- **Destroy**: Place the destroyed card face-down on the bottom of the deck. If it’s destroyed immediately after being played, it does not activate its effect.
- **Occupied**: Certain abilities (e.g., **Blockade**) only apply when a Theater has a specific number of cards. Count both players’ cards in that Theater.
- **Move**: Some abilities let you move a card to a different Theater. Retain ownership and orientation, and place it on top of existing cards. Moving is **not** playing, so effects tied to playing do not trigger.

## FAQ

- **Can I play a card into a non-matching Theater face up?**
    - Not unless a card effect explicitly allows it.
- **Do face-down cards keep their effect?**
    - No. Face-down cards are always power 2 with no effect.

## Variants

- **Beginner**: no withdrawing; winner of each battle scores 1 point; game ends with 3 points.
- **Longer game**: instead of 12 points, play until one player reaches or exceeds an arbitrary number of points.
