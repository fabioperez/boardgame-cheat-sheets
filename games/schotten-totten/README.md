# Schotten Totten

## Setup

- Place **9 Stone tiles** in a line between both players.
- Shuffle **all Clan cards** (numbers 1–9 in 6 colors) into a face-down deck.
- Each player draws **6 Clan cards**.

## Gameplay

- On your turn, **play 1 card** face-up to any Stone on your side, then **draw 1 card** (if the deck has cards).
- Once a Stone has **3 cards** on each side, both sets are fully contested. You can still claim a Stone earlier if you can prove your opponent cannot beat your set.
- If the deck is empty, continue playing without drawing until all possible moves are done or the game ends.

## Claiming Stones

- Compare your **3-card combination** against your opponent's. The **stronger** combination wins.
- **Order of strength** (strongest to weakest):

 1. **Color-Run** (three consecutive numbers in the same color)
 2. **Three of a Kind** (three cards of the same strength)
 3. **Color** (any three cards of the same color)
 4. **Run** (three consecutive numbers, any color)
 5. **Sum** (any three cards)

- Break ties by comparing total strength. If still tied, whoever finished their 3-card set **first** wins.
- You must have **3 cards** on your side to claim a Stone.
    - If your opponent has fewer than 3 cards, you can still claim if it's impossible for them to form a higher combination. You can only prove this with cards on the game (not in your hand).
- Once claimed, **move the Stone** to your side; do not play any more cards there.

## End of the Game

- The game **ends immediately** when a player controls **5 Stones** (anywhere) or **3 adjacent Stones**.
- That player **wins** the game.

## Tactic Variant

- Shuffle the **Tactic cards** into a second deck. Each player now draws **7 cards** total.
- On your turn, **play either** a Clan or Tactic card. Then draw from **one** of the two decks (if available) to return to 7 cards.
- You **cannot** play more than **1 Tactic card over** what your opponent has played.
    - Example: if the opponent played two tactic cards so far, you can play at most three.
- **Elite Troops** act like Clan cards but let you choose color/strength when resolving.
    - **Joker:** Declare color/strength upon claiming a stone. Only **one Joker** allowed per player on the table.
    - **Spy**: Declare color upon claiming a stone. Has strength 7.
    - **Shield-Bearer**: Declare color and strength (either 1, 2, or 3) upon claiming a stone.
- **Combat Modes** are placed on a Stone and modify how you form or assess combinations there.
    - **Blind-Man's Bluff**: to claim the Stone that has Blind-Man's Bluff on it, add only the strength of the cards played on it, without taking into account any possible combinations.
    - **Mud Fight**: claiming the stone that has this card requires four cards instead of three.
- **Ruses** trigger special actions like drawing, moving, or discarding cards.
    - **Recruiter**: draw three cards from one or both of the decks. Choose two cards from your entire hand and place them at the bottom of the corresponding deck.
    - **Strategist**: choose a Clan or Tactic card on your side of the border on an unclaimed Stone. Place it face-up on a different unclaimed Stone or discard it face-up next to the deck.
    - **Banshee**: choose a Clan or Tactic card on your opponent's side of the border on an unclaimed Stone and discard it face-up next to the deck.
    - **Traiter** : choose a Clan card on your opponent's side of the border on an unclaimed Stone and place it on an unclaimed Stone on your side.

## Expert Variant

- **Claim Stones** only **at the start of your turn**, before you play a card. Your opponent can try to counter before your next turn.

## FAQ

- **What if you cannot play a card?**
    - If each unclaimed Stone on your side already has 3 of your cards, you simply **skip playing**. You can still claim Stones if possible.
- **Straight sequences do not require consecutive play order.**
    - A Run (e.g. 2‑3‑4) is valid regardless of the order you played those cards.
- **You must play 3 cards to claim.**
    - You cannot claim with only 2 cards, even if you know your opponent can't beat it.
- **Proof requires only visible cards.**
    - You cannot use hidden cards in your hand for a proof, even if the deck is empty.
