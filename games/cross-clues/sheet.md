# Cross Clues

## Setup

- Choose grid size:
    - **Express:** 3x3 grid
    - **Classic:** 4x4 grid
    - **Expert:** 5x5 grid
- Arrange Axis Tiles: Place letters in one row and numbers in one column.
- Prepare Code Word Cards: Shuffle the cards. Place one card face‑up in front of each Axis Tile.
- Prepare Clue Cards: Select cards matching the grid coordinates. Shuffle and pile them face‑down.
- Each player draws one Clue Card.
    - For 2‑3 players, each draws **2 Clue Cards**.

## Gameplay

- Give a clue:
    - When ready, announce your clue out loud.
    - Speak a **single word** that links both code words on your Clue Card.
    - **Rules**:
        - Use a **single word** that relates to both code words.
        - Avoid clues sharing the **same root** as any code word.
        - Do not **reuse** any clue in any form.
        - Do not reveal the card’s coordinates.
- The team can discuss possible associations and choose one card to guess.
    - **Correct guess**: place the Clue Card in its grid position with coordinates revealed.
    - **Incorrect guess**: set the Clue Card aside without revealing its coordinates.
- After giving a clue, draw a new Clue Card.
- Play without fixed turn order; act when ready.
- The game ends when:
    - The timer runs out, or
    - No Clue Cards remain and players have no cards in hand.
- After ending, count the number of Clue Cards correctly placed in the grid to calculate the score.
