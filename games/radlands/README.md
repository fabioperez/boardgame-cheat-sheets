# Radlands

## Objective

Destroy all **3** of your opponent's camps.

## Setup

1. **Choose Camps**
    - Each player draws **6 camp cards**, chooses **3**, and places them face up in a row. Return the rest to the box.
    - Take a **Water Silo** and **Raiders** card, placing both face up.
2. **Gather Resources**
    - Each player places **3 white water discs** in their area.
    - Keep **extra black water discs** in the center for effects granting additional water.
    - Shuffle the **main draw deck** (combined People & Event cards) and leave space for a discard pile.
3. **Draw Starting Hand**
    - Add up all the **black rectangle icons** on your 3 camps; draw that many cards from the deck.
4. **Decide First Player**
    - Flip a water disc. Water side up? You go first; otherwise, your opponent does.
    - **First turn only:** the starting player replenishes with **1** water disc instead of 3.

## Turn Structure

Each turn has **three phases**, then passes to the opponent:

1. Events
    - If you have an event in the **front space** (closest to your opponent), **resolve it** then **discard** it.
    - Shift all your other events **one space forward**.
2. Replenish
    - **Draw 1 card** from the deck.
    - **Collect 3 white water discs** (unless it's the very first turn of the starting player).
3. Actions
    - You may perform these in **any order**, any number of times, as long as you have water/discards available:
    - **Play a Person**
        - Spend water equal to the person's cost; place the person in front or behind one of your camps.
        - Each column can hold **up to 2 people**. If all columns are full, you **may destroy** one of your own people first to make room.
        - A newly placed person is **not ready** (cannot use its ability this turn).
    - **Play an Event**
        - Pay its water cost, place it in the event queue on the matching numbered bomb icon.
        - If that space is occupied, place it in the first available space behind.
        - **0-time events** resolve **immediately** and are then discarded.
    - **Junk a Card**
        - Discard a card from hand to trigger its top-left **junk effect** (e.g., gain extra water, deal damage, etc.)
        - **Water Silo** junk returns it to your play area instead of discarding it.
    - **Draw a Card**
        - Pay **2 water** to draw 1 card from the deck.
    - **Take Water Silo**
        - Pay **1 water** to pick up your Water Silo card into your hand (can later be junked for +1 water).
    - **Use an Ability**
        - A card (camp or person) must be **ready** (not damaged, not used/played/restored this turn).
        - Pay the listed water cost to resolve the ability text/icons.
        - The card then becomes **not ready** this turn (mark it or turn it sideways if damaged).

**End of Actions:** Return all water discs (white and black) from cards and your supply back to the general supply.

## Key Concepts

- **Protection vs. Unprotected**
    - A camp or person without at least one of your people in front of it is **unprotected** and may be directly targeted by normal damage ( or ).
- **Damage & Destruction**
    - When a card (camp/person) is **damaged**, turn it sideways.
    - A **damaged person** that takes damage again is destroyed.
    - **Camps** flip to their destroyed side.
    - **Punks** (face-down from the deck) have no abilities; if damaged, they are immediately destroyed and returned face down on top of the draw deck.
- **Raiders**
    - Whenever you see the **Raid icon ( )**, if your Raiders event is not in your queue, place it on the **space**.
    - If already in your queue, **advance** it one space.
    - When Raiders resolves (in the front space), **your opponent** chooses one camp to damage. Then Raiders returns to your play area.
- **Ready vs. Not Ready**
    - **People** are not ready if they entered play this turn, were restored, or already used an ability.
    - **Camps** are always ready unless they used an ability this turn.
    - A **damaged** person is not ready.
- **No Self-Harm**
    - You generally **cannot** target your own cards with damage or negative effects unless a card specifically requires it (e.g., "destroy a person you control").
- **Deck Exhaustion**
    - If the draw deck empties, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
    - If it empties again, the game is a **draw**.

## Icon Quick Reference

Note: missing the icons here. See EFFECT ICONS in the manual.

- **Damage** – Damage an unprotected card (turn it sideways). If a damaged card is damaged again, it's destroyed.
- **Destroy** – Immediately discard the target person or flip the camp to destroyed. (Punk → top of deck.)
- **Restore** – Rotate a damaged card upright. (It then becomes not ready if it's a person.) A card cannot restore itself.
- **Injure** – Same as damage, but **only** hits people.
- **Gain Punk** – Place the top deck card facedown in one of your columns (counts as a person).
- **Draw** – Draw a card from the deck.
- **Gain Extra Water** – Take a black water disc to use **this turn only**, then return it.
- **Raid** – See "Raiders" above.

## End of the Game

- The moment **all 3** of an opponent's camps are destroyed, you **win immediately**.
- If the deck is reshuffled twice and empties again, the game ends in a **draw**.
