# Scout

## Setup

1. **Deal Cards**
    - Remove cards from the game depending on the number of players:
    - 3 players — remove any cards with a 10 (9 cards in total)
    - 2 or 4 players — remove the one card with a 9 and a 10
    - 5 players — don't remove any cards
    - Shuffle the deck and deal the prescribed number of cards to each player:
        - 2 players — 11 cards each + 3 Scout chips
        - 3 players — 12 cards each
        - 4 players — 11 cards each
        - 5 players — 9 cards each
2. **Orientation**
   - Each player looks at their hand _without rearranging the order_.
   - You may **flip** your entire hand upside-down if desired.
3. **Initial Display**
   - The rest of the deck is placed face-down in the center as a draw pile.

## Structure

On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

- **Show**

 1. Play a valid set (e.g., a run of consecutive numbers — ascending or descending, or identical numbers).
 2. Your combination must beat the last shown combination on the table. A set beats another if:

- it has more cards than the other set
- it has the same number of cards, but has matching numbers instead of consecutive numbers
- its highest number is higher than the highest number in the other set

 3. Collect the set that you just beat. Your played set is now the active set.

- **Scout**

 1. Take **one** card from either end of the last shown combination on the table.
 2. Insert the taken card anywhere in your hand in any orientation.
 3. (3+ players only) Award the player who showed that combination a **chip/token** for your "Scout" action.

- For 2-player game, you need to use a Scout chip when using the Scout action.
    - The chip is discarded — the other player doesn't get the card.
    - For 2-player, this action doesn't end your turn, so you can choose another action (Scout or Show).

- **Scout & Show**

 1. Perform a Scout and a Show, in order.

- Each player can only use their Scout & Show token once per round.
- This action is not allowed in a 2-player game.

- The round ends immediately when:
    - run out of cards after a show; **or**
    - after a show, no other player used Show.

## Scoring and End of the Game

- Calculate your points by:
    - adding the number of cards collected
    - adding the number of scout tokens you still have
    - subtracting the number of cards in your hand, unless you were the player that ended the round
- The player with the highest total score after a set number of rounds is the **winner**.
