# Scout

## Setup

1. Remove cards from the game:
    - 2 or 4 players — remove the one card with a 9 and a 10
    - 3 players — remove any cards with a 10 (9 cards in total)
    - 5 players — don't remove any cards
2. Shuffle the deck and deal the prescribed number of cards to each player:
    - 2 players — 11 cards each + 3 Scout chips
    - 3 players — 12 cards each
    - 4 players — 11 cards each
    - 5 players — 9 cards each
3. You may **flip** your entire hand upside-down if desired, but you **cannot rearrange the order of the cards**.
4. Place the rest of the deck face-down in the center.

## Structure

On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

- **Show**
    1. Play a **valid set**, which is any number of:
        - a run of **consecutive numbers**, ascending or descending; or
        - **identical numbers**.
    2. Your combination **must beat** the last shown combination on the table. A set beats another if:
        - it has **more cards** than the other set; if not:
        - it has the same number of cards, but with **identical numbers instead of consecutive numbers**; if not:
        - its highest number is **higher** than the highest number in the other set.
    3. Collect the set that you just beat.
    4. Your played set is now the active set.
- **Scout**
    1. Take **one** card from **either end** of the active set on the table.
    2. Insert the card (in any orientation) anywhere in your hand.
    3. (3+ players only) Award the player who played the active set a **chip/token** for your "Scout" action.
    - For **2-player game**, you need to use a Scout chip when using the Scout action.
        - The chip is discarded — the other player doesn't get the card.
        - For 2-player, this action doesn't end your turn, so you can choose another action (Scout or Show).
- **Scout & Show**
    1. Perform a Scout and a Show, in order.
    - Each player can only use their Scout & Show token once per round.
    - This action is not allowed in a 2-player game.
- The round ends immediately when:
    - you run out of cards after a show; **or**
    - after a show, no other player used Show.

## Scoring and End of the Game

- Calculate your points by:
    - (+) adding the number of cards collected
    - (+) adding the number of scout tokens you still have
    - (-) subtracting the number of cards in your hand, unless you were the player that ended the round
- The player with the highest total score after a pre-defined set number of rounds is the **winner**.
